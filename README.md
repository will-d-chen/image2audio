# Recyclopedia

Recyclopedia is a cutting-edge web application powered by machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to help users recycle their old or used products effectively. With an intuitive interface, users can simply upload an image of the item they wish to recycle, and Recyclopedia provides detailed instructions on how to recycle it, as well as information on nearby recycling centers.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of the item they want to recycle, and the app will analyze the image.
- **Recycling Instructions**: Leveraging the power of LLMs, the app provides step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the item for recycling.
- **Local Recycling Center Locator**: Recyclopedia helps users locate nearby recycling centers where they can take their items, ensuring that recyclable materials are processed correctly.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or browse to upload an image of your recyclable item.
2. **Processing**: The app uses a state-of-the-art LLM to understand the content of the image and generate recycling instructions.
3. **Recycling Info**: Get information on how to recycle the item based on material and type.
4. **Find a Recycling Center**: The app lists nearby centers where you can drop off your items, making recycling hassle-free.
