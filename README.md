# Image2Music
This project is about combining the power of large language models with AI music-making tools such as Suno, to turn images into music. By doing so, we aim to create a unique method where pictures inspire music.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of what they want to turn into music and the app will do the rest.
- **Music**: Leveraging the power of Google Gemini and Suno, the app turns any image or art into music.


## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or browse to upload an image of your recyclable item.
2. **Processing**: The app uses a state-of-the-art LLM to understand the content of the image and generate the audio description.
3. **Song**: The music will be provided via a link that the user can stream in real-time
